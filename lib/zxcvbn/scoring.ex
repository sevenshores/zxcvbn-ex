  Search most guessable match sequence

  Takes a sequence of overlapping matches, returns the non-overlapping sequence
  with minimum guesses. the following is a `O(l_max * (n + m))` dynamic
  programming algorithm for a `length - n` password with `m` candidate matches.
  `l_max` is the maximum optimal sequence length spanning each prefix of the
  password. In practice it rarely exceeds `5` and the search terminates rapidly.

  The optimal "minimum guesses" sequence is here defined to be the sequence that
  minimizes the following function:

      g = l! * Product(m.guesses for m in sequence) + D^(l - 1)

  where `l` is the length of the sequence.

  The factorial term is the number of ways to order `l` patterns.

  The `D^(l-1)` term is another length penalty, roughly capturing the idea that
  an attacker will try lower-length sequences first before trying `length - l`
  sequences.

  For example, consider a sequence that is date-repeat-dictionary.

   - an attacker would need to try other date-repeat-dictionary combinations,
     hence the product term.
   - an attacker would need to try repeat-date-dictionary, dictionary-repeat-date,
     ..., hence the factorial term.
   - an attacker would also likely try length-1 (dictionary) and length-2 (dictionary-date)
     sequences before length-3. assuming at minimum D guesses per pattern type,
     D^(l-1) approximates Sum(D^i for i in [1..l-1])
